# Thrive

The goal of the project is to create a simple Excel clone with the following features:

- Every formula is written with javascript
- Multiline formulas can be used
- The user can configure individual permissions for sheets (for example file or network access)
  to avoid security risks
- Easily extendable
- Simple file format

This is mostly a hobby project and an experiment.
